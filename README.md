Have you ever wondered which neighborhood in the city of São Paulo, Brazil is the most dangerous? And which is the most safer? You can find the answer here on this interactive map. I retrieved official statistics from SSP ([State Secretariat for Public Security of São Paulo](https://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/)).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
